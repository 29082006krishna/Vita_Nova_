# 📊 Monthly Sales & Demand Forecasting System

---

## 🌟 Overview

This project implements a **production-grade monthly sales and demand forecasting system** using **deep learning with attention mechanisms and residual connections**. The model is designed for **business-ready forecasting**, supports **user-defined horizons (3 / 6 / 12 months)**, and produces **clean, month-wise numerical and graphical outputs**.

🚫 Daily recursion is intentionally avoided. Instead, the system performs **direct monthly prediction**, ensuring **stable and realistic long-horizon forecasts**.

## 🚀 Key Capabilities

✅ Monthly-direct forecasting (no daily roll-forward noise)
✅ Multi-variable prediction:

* 📦 Quantity Sold (Sales)
* 🔁 Reorder Quantity (Demand)

✅ User-controlled forecast horizon (3 / 6 / 12 months)
✅ Calendar-correct month handling (year crossover supported)
✅ Clean, presentation-ready visualizations

## 🧱 Data Pipeline

### 🔹 Input Features

* 📈 Quantity Sold (liters/kg)
* 🛒 Reorder Quantity (liters/kg)

### 🔹 Preprocessing

* 🗓️ Date normalization and validation
* 📆 Monthly aggregation using **Month-End alignment (ME)**
* 🔢 Numeric-only aggregation to prevent datatype conflicts
* ⚖️ Min-Max scaling for stable neural network training

### 🔹 Sequence Construction

* ⏳ Lookback window: **12 months**
* 📐 Input shape: `(batch, 12, 2)`
* 🎯 Output shape: `(batch, 2)`

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### 🔷 High-Level Design

```
Input → Embedding → Positional Encoding
      → Transformer Encoder (× N layers)
      → Residual Context Fusion
      → Deep Fully Connected Head
      → Monthly Sales & Demand Output
```

### 🔹 Core Components

#### 1️⃣ Embedding Layer

* Projects raw inputs into a high-dimensional latent space
* Enables richer temporal representations

#### 2️⃣ Positional Encoding

* Injects month-order information into the model
* Preserves temporal awareness without recurrence

#### 3️⃣ Transformer Encoder

* 🧩 Multi-Head Self-Attention
* 🔗 Captures long-range temporal dependencies
* 🎯 Learns which past months influence future demand

#### 4️⃣ Residual Connections

* 🔁 Combines:

  * Last time-step representation
  * Global sequence context
* 🛡️ Prevents trend flattening
* ⚙️ Stabilizes deep learning dynamics

#### 5️⃣ Deep Feed-Forward Head

* 🧠 Multi-layer nonlinear mapping
* 🔍 Models complex sales–demand relationships

## 🎯 Attention Mechanism

✨ Automatically assigns importance weights to historical months
📌 Learns seasonality, trend shifts, and demand spikes
🚀 Eliminates uniform time-step bias present in plain LSTM models

---

## 🧬 Residual Learning

Residual connections ensure:

* 🔄 Stable gradient flow
* 🧠 Preservation of temporal signals
* 📈 Improved long-horizon forecast realism

This design prevents the common **straight-line prediction problem**.

## 🔮 Forecasting Strategy

### 📆 Monthly-Direct Prediction

* Predicts each future month explicitly
* ❌ No compounding daily errors
* ✅ Suitable for business planning and inventory decisions

### 🗓️ Calendar-Correct Horizon

| User Input | Forecast Period         |
| ---------- | ----------------------- |
| 3          | Next 3 calendar months  |
| 6          | Next 6 calendar months  |
| 12         | Next 12 calendar months |
